      "Farmers work hard to grow crops and feed the nation, but they face many challenges. One big problem is keeping soil healthy without spending too much money.",
      "Chemical fertilizers can harm the soil over time, and good-quality organic manure is hard to find. Meanwhile, India produces huge amounts of organic waste—like crop residues, vegetable peels, and cow dung—every day. Much of this waste goes unused or causes pollution.",
      "What if farmers could turn this waste into something valuable for their fields? Navyakosh Organic Fertilizer, made by LCB Fertilizers, does exactly that. It transforms organic waste into a nutrient-rich fertilizer that helps crops grow better and keeps soil healthy.",
      "Every day, India produces about 65,000 tons of organic waste. This includes crop residues like rice straw, wheat stalks, and sugarcane tops, as well as kitchen scraps and animal manure.",
      "Sadly, much of this waste is burned, dumped in landfills, or left to rot. Burning crop residues, especially in states like Punjab and Haryana, causes air pollution and releases harmful gases. Dumping waste in landfills takes up space and pollutes water sources.",
      "According to the Ministry of Agriculture, only a small part of this waste is used as manure because turning it into compost takes time and effort.",
      "Farmers often struggle to find good organic manure. Many use chemical fertilizers because they are cheap and easy to get. But chemicals can make soil less fertile over time, reduce crop quality, and harm the environment.",
      "Organic manure, like cow dung or compost, is better for soil, but it’s not always available in large amounts. This is where Navyakosh steps in. It uses organic waste to create a fertilizer that’s easy to use, affordable, and good for the soil.",
      "Navyakosh Organic Fertilizer is a product made by LCB Fertilizers, a company started by farmers for farmers. It’s 100% organic, meaning it has no harmful chemicals.",
      "Navyakosh is made from agricultural biomass (like crop residues), cow dung, and special microbes. These microbes are tiny living things that help plants grow by making nutrients easier to absorb.",
      "The Navyakosh Organic fertilizer also contains 9 important nutrients like nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), zinc, sulfur, and iron etc., which crops need to stay healthy.",
      "Scientists at IIT Kanpur helped create Navyakosh, and it’s approved by government labs.",
      "Trials show it can increase crop yields by 15–35% , improve soil organic matter by 32–74%, and save 33% of water used for irrigation.",
      "Farmers who use Navyakosh spend less money—about Rs 3,500–4,000 per acre compared to Rs 6,500 for chemical fertilizers. It works for many crops, including wheat, mungbean, rice, mustard, and vegetables, and even for home gardens with plants like roses or money plants.",
      "Navyakosh starts with organic waste that most people throw away. Here’s how it works:",
      "Collecting Waste : LCB Fertilizers gathers crop residues, such as rice straw or wheat stalks, and cow dung from farms. They also use agricultural biomass like sugarcane bagasse or vegetable waste. This waste is often low in price, making Navyakosh affordable.",
      "Adding Microbes : The waste is mixed with special microbes like Rhizobium, Bacillus, and Pseudomonas. These microbes break down the waste and turn it into nutrients that plants can use. Rhizobium helps legumes like mungbean fix nitrogen from the air, while Bacillus makes phosphorus available to roots.",
      "Creating the Fertilizer : The mixture is processed in a controlled way to ensure it’s rich in nutrients. Navyakosh also includes super absorbent polymers, which are like tiny sponges that hold water in the soil. This helps crops stay hydrated even in dry areas.",
      "Testing and Packing : The final product is tested to make sure it’s safe and effective. Then, it’s packed into bags or bottles and sent to farmers and gardeners across India. You can buy Navyakosh on Amazon or through LCB’s website.",
      "This process turns waste that could harm the environment into a product that helps farmers grow better crops. It’s a simple idea with big benefits.",
      "Soil is like a living thing. It needs food to stay healthy, just like people do. Organic waste, when turned into manure or fertilizer, feeds the soil with nutrients and organic matter.",
      "Organic matter is the part of soil that holds water, supports microbes, and keeps soil loose so roots can grow. In India, many soils have low organic matter—sometimes less than 1%—because of heavy chemical fertilizer use. This makes crops weaker and reduces yields over time.",
      "Navyakosh adds organic matter back to the soil. In trials, it increased organic matter by 32–74%, making soil more fertile.",
      "For example, a soil test from Birasini Test House showed that clay soils in Uttar Pradesh, which are common in India, benefit from organic fertilizers like Navyakosh.",
      "The test found moderate nutrient levels but low organic matter, which Navyakosh can improve. Healthier soil means stronger crops, better harvests, and less need for expensive chemicals.",
      "Navyakosh is easy to use for both farmers and gardeners. Here are some simple ways to use it:",
      "For Field Crops : Sprinkle 200–400 grams of Navyakosh around the base of plants like wheat, rice, or mungbean. Water the soil well to help the nutrients soak in. Apply it when sowing seeds or during early growth stages for best results. To get better result of Navyakosh, we have given dosage required for each crop on our website you can check that too.",
      "For Vegetables : Mix Navyakosh into the soil before planting crops like tomatoes or brinjal. Use 200 grams per plant every 2–3 months to keep the soil rich.",
      "For Home Gardens : Add a small handful of Navyakosh to pots with flowers or indoor plants like money plant. Water lightly after applying. It’s safe for all plants and won’t burn roots.",
      "With Irrigation : If you have drip irrigation, mix Navyakosh with water to deliver nutrients directly to roots. This saves water and fertilizer.",
      "Navyakosh works well with clay soils, like those in the Birasini Test House report, because it improves soil structure and water retention. Farmers in dry areas like Rajasthan or Bihar can benefit from its water-saving technology, which reduces irrigation by 33%.",
      "You can make your own compost at home and combine it with Navyakosh for even better results. Here’s how:",
      "Collect Waste : Gather crop residues, vegetable peels, fruit scraps, and cow dung. Avoid meat, oily food, or plastic.",
      "Set Up a Compost Pile : Find a shady spot in your yard. Layer the waste in a pile or a bin, alternating green waste (like vegetable peels) with dry waste (like straw or leaves).",
      "Add Navyakosh : Sprinkle a small amount of Navyakosh into the pile. Its microbes will help break down the waste faster.",
      "Turn the Pile : Mix the pile every 1–2 weeks to add air. Keep it moist but not soggy, like a wrung-out sponge.",
      "Wait 60–90 Days : The compost will turn dark and crumbly. Mix it with Navyakosh and apply it to your fields or garden.",
      "This method turns your waste into rich manure. Using Navyakosh speeds up the process and adds extra nutrients.",
      "Navyakosh offers many benefits for farmers and gardeners:",
      "Improves Soil Health : It adds organic matter, making soil softer and more fertile. Trials show a 32–74% increase in organic matter.",
      "Boosts Yields : Farmers see 15–35% higher yields for crops like wheat and mungbean.",
      "Saves Money : It costs less than chemical fertilizers, with farmers spending Rs 3,500–4,000 per acre instead of Rs 6,500.",
      "Saves Water : Its water-retaining technology reduces irrigation by 33%, helping farmers in dry areas.",
      "Protects Crops : Microbes like Trichoderma fight pests naturally, reducing the need for chemical pesticides.",
      "Safe for the Environment : Navyakosh has no harmful chemicals or heavy metals, unlike some fertilizers that contain cadmium or lead.",
      "These benefits come from Navyakosh’s unique mix of organic waste, microbes, and water-saving technology. It’s a simple way to make farming more sustainable.",
      "Using organic waste isn’t just about making fertilizer—it’s about changing how we farm. India’s 65,000 tons of daily organic waste is a huge resource.",
      "If farmers and communities work together, they can turn this waste into wealth for everyone. Here’s why it’s a big opportunity:",
      "Reduces Pollution : Instead of burning crop residues or dumping waste, using it for fertilizer cleans the air and water. The Central Pollution Control Board says crop burning contributes 20% to Delhi’s winter pollution.",
      "Saves Money : Farmers spend less on fertilizers when they use waste-based products like Navyakosh. Composting at home cuts costs even more.",
      "Creates Jobs : Collecting and processing waste can create jobs in rural areas. LCB Fertilizers works with farmers to gather waste, supporting local communities.",
      "Supports Sustainable Farming : Organic waste improves soil health, reduces chemical use, and helps crops grow better in the long run.",
      "Navyakosh shows how to turn this opportunity into reality. By using waste, farmers can grow healthier crops and protect the environment.",
      "Using organic waste has some challenges, but there are simple solutions:",
      "Challenge : Composting takes time and space.",
