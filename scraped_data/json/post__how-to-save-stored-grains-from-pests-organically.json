      "Pest infestations in stored grains are a common problem for farmers. These pests can destroy crops and cause big losses. Using organic methods can protect grains without harming the environment or health. Here are seven simple ways to handle pests in stored grains:",
      "Before storing grains, clean the storage area. Remove old grains, dust, and dirt. Pests often hide in cracks and corners. Cleaning the area removes pests and their eggs.",
      "Sweep the floors, wipe down walls, and inspect the area for any gaps or holes. Seal these gaps to prevent pests from entering. A clean storage area is the first step to keeping your grains safe.",
      "Moist grains attract pests. Dry grains under the sun until they are completely dry. Spread the grains on a clean surface in a thin layer to ensure even drying. Stir the grains occasionally to speed up the process.",
      "Properly dried grains not only prevent pest infestations but also reduce the risk of mould and fungal growth. Storing dry grains ensures their quality remains intact for longer periods.",
      "Neem leaves are a natural pest repellent. Place fresh neem leaves in layers with the stored grains. The strong smell of neem keeps pests away. You can also use neem powder if fresh leaves are unavailable.",
      "Another method is to prepare neem oil and spray it lightly on the storage sacks or containers. Neem has been used for generations and is an affordable and effective solution for pest control.",
      "Airtight containers block pests from entering. Use clean and dry metal or plastic containers with tight lids. Ensure there are no gaps or holes.",
      "For extra protection, line the containers with a cloth or plastic sheet before placing the grains inside.",
      "If you are storing grains in sacks, double-layer them to reduce the risk of pest infestation. Regularly inspect the containers or sacks for any signs of damage.",
      "Wood ash is a traditional method to protect grains. Mix a small amount of ash with the grains. It forms a protective layer and prevents pests from damaging the grains.",
      "Ensure the ash is clean and free from chemicals. Ash works by creating an uninhabitable environment for pests. This method is especially useful for small-scale storage and is cost-effective for farmers.",
      "Coating grains with mustard oil creates a barrier that pests cannot cross. Use a small amount of oil and mix it well with the grains. This method works well for grains like wheat and pulses.",
      "The oil also adds a natural shine to the grains and can improve their market value. Make sure the oil is evenly spread to ensure complete protection. Mustard oil is a simple and natural way to keep pests at bay.",
      "You can make natural pest control powders at home. Mix turmeric, neem powder, and ash. Sprinkle this mixture over the grains to keep pests away.",
      "Another option is to use diatomaceous earth, a natural powder made from fossilized algae.",
      "It works by dehydrating pests and is safe for humans. Regularly reapply the powder to maintain its effectiveness. Organic powders are a versatile and eco-friendly solution for pest control.",
      "Handling pest infestations in stored grains organically is simple and effective. Clean storage areas, dry grains properly, and use natural solutions like neem leaves, ash, and mustard oil.",
      "Store grains in airtight containers and apply organic pest control powders. These methods protect your grains and ensure they remain safe for consumption.",
      "By adopting these practices, you can prevent losses and preserve the quality of your harvest. Start using these tips today to safeguard your hard-earned grains for the future."
