      "Indian farmers and gardeners work hard every day to grow food and crops. But they face many challenges. Soil loses its strength, yields stay low, costs rise, nutrients disappear, and trust in fertilizers fades.",
      "Navyakosh Organic Fertilizer from LCB Fertilizers offers a solution. It contains special nutrients like Carbon, Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, Sulphur, Zinc, Iron, Copper, and Manganese. These nutrients work together to make farming better.",
      "Today we will explain each component of Navyakosh, and why it matters in Navyakosh, how it supports organic farming, and how it helps farmers and gardeners solve their problems.",
      "Navyakosh comes in a 1kg pack (Concentrated Formula) and 50kg pack and holds a mix of nutrients. Here are the key components and their amounts:",
      "Carbon: 74%",
      "Nitrogen: 276 kg/ha",
      "Phosphorus: 12 kg/ha",
      "Potassium: 162 kg/ha",
      "Sulphur: 11 ppm",
      "Zinc: 0.87 ppm",
      "Iron: 4.0 ppm",
      "Copper: 2.7 ppm",
      "Manganese: 3.8 ppm",
      "These numbers show how much of each nutrient Navyakosh provides. The pack also includes 20–60 microbial strains and a Super Absorbent Polymer (SAP) that saves 33% irrigation water. Field trials prove its effectiveness. Now, let’s look at each nutrient and its role.",
      "Carbon makes up 74% of Navyakosh . It acts like food for the soil. When farmers add Navyakosh, Carbon builds organic matter.",
      "Trials show this increases soil organic matter by 32–74% , with a 42% rise in some areas. Healthy soil holds water better and supports roots.",
      "For Indian farmers, dry and sandy soils often break down. Carbon fights this degradation. It also helps crops grow strong over time.",
      "Gardeners benefit too, as their small plots stay fertile longer. Using Navyakosh with Carbon saves soil and reduces the need for frequent replanting.",
      "Nitrogen in Navyakosh measures 276 kg/ha . It feeds plants and helps them grow leaves and stems.",
      "Field trials show a 4.95% yield increase in wheat and a 5% boost over chemical fertilizers for mungbean .",
      "This nutrient tackles low yields, a big problem for farmers. In India, many soils lack nitrogen, making crops weak.",
      "Navyakosh’s Nitrogen, combined with microbes like Rhizobium, fixes nitrogen from the air.",
      "This reduces the need for costly chemical fertilizers. Gardeners see greener plants and bigger harvests. Farmers save money and grow more food with this natural boost.",
      "Phosphorus in Navyakosh stands at 12 kg/ha . It strengthens roots and helps plants flower and fruit.",
      "Filed trials show a 30.9% increase in soil phosphorus, from 15.5 kg/ha to 20.3 kg/ha .",
      "Many Indian soils, especially alkaline ones with a pH of 8.66, lock up phosphorus. This stops crops from growing well.",
      "Navyakosh unlocks this nutrient, aiding root growth for crops like Mango and Chickpea.",
      "Farmers notice better fruit sets, while gardeners enjoy healthier plants. This solves the pain of nutrient shortages and improves yields naturally.",
      "Potassium in Navyakosh measures 162 kg/ha . It makes plants strong against diseases and drought.",
      "Filed trials report a 28.7% increase in soil potassium, from 150 kg/ha to 193 kg/ha .",
      "In India, crops often suffer from pests and dry weather. Potassium helps plants resist these problems. It also improves fruit quality, which matters for gardeners selling produce.",
      "Farmers see fewer sick plants and better harvests. Navyakosh’s Potassium addresses the pain of crop losses and builds resilient farms.",
      "Sulphur in Navyakosh is 11 ppm . It helps plants make proteins and stay healthy.",
      "The mungbean field trial of Navyakosh shows a 9.4% increase in soil moisture, from 19.0% to 20.8% . This helps during dry seasons, a common issue in India.",
      "Sulphur also supports water retention, reducing irrigation needs. Farmers save water and money, while gardeners keep plants alive in heat. Navyakosh’s Sulphur tackles the issue of water scarcity and improves crop survival .",
      "Zinc in Navyakosh is 0.87 ppm . It helps plants grow taller and stronger. It also fights off diseases.",
      "Many Indian soils lack Zinc, causing stunted crops. Navyakosh adds this trace element, supporting overall health . Farmers see better growth in pulses and fruits, while gardeners notice healthier leaves. This solves the problem of nutrient deficiencies in crops.",
      "Iron in Navyakosh measures 4.0 ppm . It helps plants make chlorophyll, the green part that captures sunlight.",
      "Low Iron turns leaves yellow, a problem in many farms. Navyakosh supplies enough Iron to keep leaves green and plants active.",
      "The Iron component of the Navyakosh addresses the pain of poor plant health and improves harvest quality.",
      "Copper in Navyakosh is 2.7 ppm . It protects plants from fungi and bacteria.",
      "In India, wet seasons bring diseases that harm crops. Navyakosh’s Copper strengthens plant defenses . Farmers lose fewer crops, and gardeners keep their plants safe.",
      "This tackles the problem of pest and disease losses, offering a natural shield.",
      "Manganese in Navyakosh is 3.8 ppm . It balances other nutrients and helps plants use them well.",
      "Many soils lack Manganese, leading to weak growth. Navyakosh ensures plants get this balance, supporting crops like wheat and Mango.",
      "With Manganese component in available in enough amount, farmers see steady yields, and gardeners grow healthier plants .",
      "This addresses the issue of uneven nutrient use and builds trust in organic farming.",
      "Organic farming avoids chemicals, but it needs the right nutrients. Navyakosh provides these nutrients naturally.",
      "The 20–60 microbial strains present in Navyakosh break down nutrients, making them easy for plants to absorb.",
      "The SAP (Super Absorbent Polymer Technology) saves water, cutting irrigation costs by 33%. Field trials of Navyakosh shows a 30–50% reduction in chemical use, protecting the environment.",
      "That is why Navyakosh suits best for India’s diverse soils and climate. Farmers and gardeners grow food without harming nature, solving the issue of chemical dependency.",
      "Indian farmers and gardeners face tough challenges. Navyakosh addresses them with its nutrients in following manner:",
      "Navyakosh Prevents Low Yields : The 4.95% yield increase (Nayakosh’s Field Trail Data) in wheat and 29% boost in mungbean over control help farmers grow more. Gardeners see bigger harvests too.",
      "Navyakosh Prevents Soil Degradation : The 32–74% organic matter rise fights soil loss. Carbon and Phosphorus restore alkaline soils (pH 8.66), while moisture rises by 9.4%. Farmers save their land, and gardeners keep plots fertile.",
      "Cuts High Cost : Navyakosh cuts chemical use by 30–50% (Nayakosh’s Field Trail Data) and saves upto 50% on costs. Therefore farmers and gardeners spend less while earning more.",
      "Nutrient Deficiencies : Nitrogen (276 kg/ha), Phosphorus (12 kg/ha), and trace elements like Zinc and Iron fill nutrient gaps. This solves weak crops and poor quality, boosting farmer’s yield and confidence.",
