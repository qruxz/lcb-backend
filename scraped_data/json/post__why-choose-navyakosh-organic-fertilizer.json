      "LCB Fertilizers presents Navyakosh, an organic fertilizer for farmers seeking organic farming solutions. Navyakosh organic fertilizer helps farmers boost productivity and sustainability.",
      "With Navyakosh, farmers utilize the benefits of organic farming while achieving higher yields and saving resources. Navyakosh have many features like—Eco Friendly, Increases Yield, Reduces Water Usage, Nutrient Rich, Government Backed, and Lab Approved.",
      "We are going to use data from our field trials, soil tests, and gazette notifications to show Navyakosh’s value in simple terms.",
      "Navyakosh keeps the environment safe with its 100% organic formula . LCB Fertilizers crafts Navyakosh using natural materials like cow dung, fermented organic manure, and agricultural waste such as paddy straw and bagasse. Unlike chemical fertilizers that harm soil and water, Navyakosh improves soil health.",
      "Our trials show Navyakosh increases soil organic matter by 32–74%, with field tests reporting a 42% rise in the soil organic matter. The mungbean study reveals Navyakosh boosts soil phosphorus (P) by 30.9% and potassium (K) by 28.7% .",
      "Navyakosh also cuts chemical use by 30–50%, reducing harmful residues in soil and crops. We also do bio-CNG projects with Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum, highlighting how we recycle waste into energy and fertilizers. Farmers choose Navyakosh to farm in an eco-friendly way, protecting the planet for future generations.",
      "Navyakosh helps farmers grow more crops with its powerful organic formula. Our field trials prove Navyakosh boosts yields across different crops.",
      "Wheat trials with DAV College Gorakhpur show a 4.95% yield increase over chemical fertilizers.",
      "Mungbean trials with ICAR-IIPR Kanpur report a 5% yield increase over recommended chemical fertilizers and a 29% increase over the control.",
      "Navyakosh supports crops like wheat, paddy, sugarcane, pulses, spices, fruits, and vegetables etc. Navyakosh helps attain 15–35% yield increase, depending on the crop and region.",
      "Navyakosh also shortens crop duration by 5–8%, as seen in the mungbean study where maturity reduces by 2–4 days.",
      "In January, 2024, a farmer from Kushinagar shared his story, where Navyakosh increased his paddy yield by 20%. Farmers trust Navyakosh to grow more and harvest faster.",
      "Navyakosh saves water, making farming easier in dry areas. Our super absorbent polymer technology (SAP) absorbs 268 times its weight in water and holds it for 35 days. This feature cuts irrigation needs by 33%, a big help in India where 85% of groundwater goes to farming.",
      "The mungbean study shows Navyakosh increases soil moisture by 9.4%, from 19.0% to 20.8%. Farmers in water-scarce regions benefit the most, as Navyakosh keeps soil moist longer.",
      "In February, 2024, a farmer from Mahoba reduced irrigation rounds by 30% using Navyakosh on sugarcane crop. Navyakosh ensures crops thrive with less water, saving resources and effort.",
      "Navyakosh fertilizer provides a rich mix of nutrients for healthy crops. Our Navyakosh Organic Fertilizer contains 20–60 microbial strains that deliver nine essential nutrients, including nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), zinc (Zn), sulphur (S), iron (Fe), magnesium (Mg), copper (Cu), and carbon (C).",
      "The soil test report shows a clay soil with low nitrogen (276 kg/ha) and medium levels of P (Phosphorous) (12 kg/ha) and K (Potassium) (162 kg/ha). Navyakosh fixes this by increasing soil P (Phosphorous) by 30.9% and K (Potassium) by 28.7%, as seen in the mungbean study.",
      "Navyakosh’s one-time application ensures crops get all nutrients without extra fertilizers.",
      "A farmer in Prayagraj who saw healthier wheat plants with Navyakosh, praised and thanked to the nutrient-rich formula of Navyakosh. Farmers rely on Navyakosh to feed their crops for strong growth.",
      "Navyakosh gains support from the Government of India, ensuring trust and quality.",
      "The Fertiliser (Control) Fourth Amendment Order, 2023, exempts manufacturers of Fermented Organic Manure—like Navyakosh—from needing an authorization letter until May 2026. This shows the government’s confidence in Navyakosh organic fertilizer.",
      "LCB Fertilizers partners with government-backed initiatives, including Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) and agricultural universities for trials.",
      "Our production units in Damoh (with MP Government) and Sonipath (with PSA GOI) reflect strong government ties.",
      "Navyakosh aligns with schemes like Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana, promoting chemical-free farming.",
      "In April, 2024, we did a collaboration with an FPO funded by the Melinda Gates Foundation, further showcasing our government-backed credibility. Farmers choose Navyakosh knowing it meets official standards.",

      "Our field trials with DAV College Gorakhpur and ICAR-IIPR Kanpur confirm Navyakosh’s benefits, such as a 4.95% yield increase in wheat and a 9.4% soil moisture increase in mungbean.",
      "Navyakosh’s nanoparticles (20.93 nm) and SAP (Super Absorbent Polymer Technology) undergo rigorous testing.",
      "In March, 2024, Navyakosh received approval from a leading agricultural lab in Uttar Pradesh for its microbial efficacy. Farmers depend on Navyakosh, knowing labs approve its quality and performance.",
