### Paragraphs
At LCB Fertilizers, we are committed to revolutionizing agriculture through sustainable, innovative, and farmer-centric solutions. Our mission, encapsulated in our slogan "From the Farmers, By the Farmers, For the Farmers," drives us to empower farmers with the tools and knowledge they need to thrive.
As a leading provider of crop-specific biofertilizers, we offer a range of services designed to address the challenges of modern farming while promoting environmental sustainability and economic growth.
Today, we’ll explore the key services offered by lcbfertilizers.com , showcasing how we support farmers, foster collaboration, and contribute to a greener future.
At the heart of LCB Fertilizers is our flagship product, Navyakosh , a microbial inoculant and nanocomposite biofertilizer designed to meet the unique needs of specific crops.
Unlike conventional chemical fertilizers that degrade soil health, Navyakosh is a 100% organic, one-time-use solution that delivers essential nutrients like nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), zinc (Zn), sulphur (S), iron (Fe), magnesium (Mg), copper (Cu), and carbon (C).
Our biofertilizers are developed using a synergistic combination of biotechnology, nanotechnology, and chemical engineering, ensuring optimal nutrient delivery and soil health enhancement.
Proven Results : Field trials conducted with DAV College Gorakhpur (for wheat) and ICAR-IIPR Kanpur (for mungbean) demonstrate Navyakosh’s efficacy. For wheat, it increased yields by 4.95% over chemical fertilizers while reducing costs by 15.02%. For mungbean, it achieved a 5% yield increase over recommended chemical fertilizers (RCF) and a 29% increase over the control, alongside a 30.9% increase in soil P and 28.7% in soil K.
Technical Innovation : Navyakosh contains a consortium of 20–60 microbial strains, 20.93 nm biogenically synthesized nanoparticles, and a super absorbent polymer (SAP) that absorbs 268 times its weight in water. This combination not only provides nutrients but also enhances soil organic matter (32–74% increase, with field trials showing a 42% rise) and improves water retention, reducing irrigation needs by 33%.
Crop Coverage : Our fertilizers cater to a wide range of crops, including wheat, paddy, sugarcane, pulses, spices, fruits, and vegetables, ensuring that every farmer can find a tailored solution for their fields.
By choosing our crop-specific fertilizers, farmers can reduce their reliance on chemical inputs, lower farming expenses (up to 21% reduction), and achieve yield increases of 15–35%, depending on seasonal and geographical variations.
We understand that successful farming goes beyond just providing products—it requires knowledge and guidance. Our Crop Advisory for Farmers service is designed to empower farmers with the information they need to make informed decisions.
Through this service, we offer personalized recommendations on crop management, soil health, and the optimal use of our biofertilizers.
Farmer Engagement : We organize Kisan Chaupals (farmer camps) at the block and village levels, as outlined in our four-step commercialization model. These events provide a platform for farmers to learn about sustainable farming practices, understand the benefits of Navyakosh, and receive hands-on training.
Scientific Validation : Our advisory services are backed by extensive field trials conducted in regions like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Jharkhand. For instance, the soil test report from Birasini Test House revealed a clay soil with low nitrogen (276 kg/ha) and a high pH (8.66). Our advisors can recommend Navyakosh to address the nitrogen deficiency (via its nitrogen-fixing microbes) and suggest pH correction strategies (e.g., using gypsum) to improve nutrient availability.
Practical Solutions : We guide farmers on reducing irrigation demands by 33% through Navyakosh’s SAP (Super Absorbent Polymer Technology), which retains water for up to 35 days. This is particularly beneficial in water-scarce regions, where 54% of India’s agriculture is rainfed (FAO, 2023).
Our crop advisory service ensures that farmers not only use our products effectively but also adopt sustainable practices that enhance long-term productivity and soil health.
Innovation is at the core of LCB Fertilizers, and our Joint Technology Development service reflects our commitment to advancing agricultural solutions through collaboration.
We partner with research institutions, agricultural universities, and organizations to develop cutting-edge technologies that address the evolving needs of farmers.
Technological Advancements : Our biofertilizers integrate three key domains: biotechnology (60 microbial strains producing 9 essential nutrients), nanotechnology (20.93 nm nanoparticles enhancing microbial activity up to 78°C), and chemical engineering (low-cost bioreactors and SAP). These innovations were detailed in the fifth document and validated through trials in the first and second documents.
Collaborative Trials : We have conducted ground trials with institutions like DAV College Gorakhpur and ICAR-IIPR Kanpur, as well as Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) and agricultural universities across India. These trials provide empirical evidence of Navyakosh’s benefits, such as a 5–8% reduction in crop duration (e.g., mungbean maturity reduced by 2–4 days) and improved soil health.
Industry Partnerships : Our joint research with several PSU's showcase our ability to innovate beyond fertilizers, creating value from fermented organic manure while producing crop-specific solutions.
Through joint technology development, we aim to stay at the forefront of agricultural innovation, delivering solutions that are both effective and sustainable.
Our Technical Guidance to Farmers service goes hand-in-hand with our crop advisory, providing hands-on support to ensure farmers can maximize the benefits of our products. We offer training on the application of  Navyakosh, soil management, and sustainable farming techniques.
Application Support : Navyakosh is a one-time-use product, eliminating the need for additional fertilizers during the crop cycle. We guide farmers on its application rates (e.g., 100 kg for wheat, 375 kg/ha for mungbean, as per the first and second documents) to achieve optimal results. We have also explained crop specific application of Navyakosh for different specific crops so that farmers can take maximum advantage of it.
Soil Health Management : The soil test report from Birasini Test House highlighted a clay soil with low nitrogen and a high pH. Our technical guidance includes recommendations for pH correction and the use of Navyakosh to enhance nutrient availability, as demonstrated by the mungbean study’s 30.9% increase in soil P (Phosphorous) and 28.7% in soil K (Potassium).
Farmer Training : Through farmer meetings and training programs, we educate farmers on reducing chemical fertilizer use by 30–50% and improving yields by 15–35%. Real-world results (4.95–5% yield increase over chemical fertilizers) provide a practical benchmark for farmers to aim for.
By offering technical guidance, we ensure that farmers are equipped with the skills and knowledge to adopt sustainable practices and achieve better outcomes.
Collaboration is key to scaling our impact, and our Partnerships and Collaboration service reflects our commitment to working with a wide range of stakeholders. We partner with Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs), NGOs, Self-Help Groups (SHGs), and industry leaders to expand our reach and empower communities.
Community Engagement : We collaborate with 100 FPOs, 60 NGOs, 20 NPOs, 200 SHGs, and 10 institutes in Uttar Pradesh, fostering economic empowerment through higher margins and savings. Our partnerships with EY-funded FPOs, Tata Trust, Melinda Gates Foundation, and Paani Foundation demonstrate our credibility and reach.
Industry Alliances : Our joint ventures with Mayur Group for a 500 ton/month unit in the Northeast (starting 2025) and with petroleum companies for bio-CNG development highlight our ability to create synergies across sectors.
Micro-Entrepreneurship : We establish outlets and stores to make our products accessible, as part of our four-step commercialization model.
