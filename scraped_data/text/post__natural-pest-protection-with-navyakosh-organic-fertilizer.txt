### Paragraphs
Pests and diseases affect crop growth. Farmers often use chemical pesticides to protect their crops. But these chemicals can harm the soil, the environment, and the health of the people who consume the crops.
Navyakosh offers a better solution. It uses the power of nature to protect crops. It helps farmers grow healthy crops without depending on harmful chemicals.
Today we will understand how Navyakosh’s organic formula supports natural pest protection. We will look at its key microbial components, especially Trichoderma, and how they keep crops safe. We will also explain how it reduces the need for chemical pesticides.
Navyakosh is an organic fertilizer made by LCB Fertilizers. It supports plant growth, strengthens roots, and protects crops from pests and diseases.
Navyakosh contains living microbes that improve soil health. These microbes build a strong base for crops. They also protect plants by fighting harmful pests and fungi.
One of the main microbes in Navyakosh is Trichoderma. It plays a major role in natural pest protection.
Trichoderma is a helpful fungus found in healthy soil. Navyakosh contains a high count of Trichoderma. This fungus grows near plant roots. It blocks harmful fungi and pests from reaching the plant.
Here is how Trichoderma works:
Fights Harmful Fungi : Trichoderma attacks fungi that cause diseases. It eats them and stops their growth.
Boosts Plant Strength : Trichoderma helps the plant grow strong roots. Strong roots take up more nutrients. Healthy plants can fight pests better.
Builds Natural Shield : Trichoderma creates a barrier around roots. This barrier keeps harmful fungi away.
Improves Soil Health : It adds helpful nutrients to the soil. It also increases the number of good microbes.
Trichoderma does not harm the plant or the soil. It works with the plant and soil to create a healthy farm system.
Navyakosh also contains other helpful microbes. These include:
Bacillus subtilis : It kills disease-causing fungi and bacteria. It helps plants grow better.
Pseudomonas fluorescens : It keeps root diseases away. It protects crops during their early stages.
Azotobacter and Azospirillum : These microbes fix nitrogen from the air. They give plants the nitrogen they need to grow.
Phosphate Solubilising Bacteria (PSB) : These microbes release phosphorus in the soil. Plants need phosphorus for strong roots.
These microbes work together. They protect the crop. They improve the soil. They help the plant grow healthy and strong.
When farmers use Navyakosh, they do not need to depend on harmful pesticides. Here is how Navyakosh offers natural pest protection:
Reduces Disease Spread : The microbes stop the growth of harmful fungi. This reduces the chance of disease.
Stops Pest Attack : Healthy plants can resist pests. Navyakosh helps crops become strong. Pests avoid strong plants.
Keeps Soil Healthy : Healthy soil supports healthy plants. The microbes in Navyakosh improve soil life.
No Chemical Residue : Navyakosh does not leave any harmful chemical in the soil or the crop. This keeps the crop safe for people to eat.
Eco-Friendly Farming : Farmers can protect the environment by avoiding harmful sprays. Navyakosh supports clean and green farming.
Chemical pesticides may give fast results. But they also bring many problems. They can:
Kill helpful insects
Harm soil health
Leave harmful residue on crops
Cause health problems for humans and animals
Make pests stronger over time
Navyakosh works with nature. It improves the farm system. It does not fight against nature. It helps farmers grow crops that are safe, healthy, and good for the environment.
Navyakosh has passed NABL lab tests. It is approved and trusted by experts. It is recognised by the Government of India as a startup. Institutes like IIT Kanpur and CITI India support it. Farmers can trust Navyakosh for quality and safety.
Navyakosh is made using research and experience. The makers understand farming problems. They have designed Navyakosh to solve these problems in a safe way.
Using Navyakosh is easy. Farmers should follow the usage instructions on the pack or ask experts for help. They can also use it during seed treatment or drip irrigation.
Regular use of Navyakosh improves soil and crop health. It gives long-term protection against pests and diseases.
Natural pest protection is the need of the hour. Farmers want safe methods that do not harm the soil or people. Navyakosh gives them a way to protect their crops without using dangerous chemicals.
The power of microbes, like Trichoderma, offers strong defence. They help crops fight pests and diseases in a natural way. Navyakosh uses this power to support farmers. It helps them grow better, safer crops.
Switching to Navyakosh means choosing health. It means choosing safety. It means choosing nature.
Use Navyakosh. Protect your crop. Keep your soil alive. Grow naturally.
