### Paragraphs
LCB Fertilizers introduces a transformative approach to agriculture with our motto, " For the Farmers, By the Farmers ." LCB Fertilizers showcases its dedication to sustainable farming through Navyakosh, a crop-specific biofertilizer .
We combine biotechnology, nanotechnology, and chemical engineering to create unique, microbe-rich fertilizers that cater to diverse agricultural needs.
Further we will highlight how Navyakosh supports farms, gardens, and terrace gardening . We use data from field trials, soil tests, and operational insights to demonstrate our impact.
LCB Fertilizers leads the way in sustainable agriculture with Navyakosh, a 100% organic biofertilizer tailored for specific crops.
Our product features a microbial consortium of 20–60 strains, 20.93 nm biogenically synthesized nanoparticles, and a super absorbent polymer (SAP) that absorbs 268 times its weight in water.
Navyakosh provides essential nutrients like nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), zinc (Zn), sulphur (S), iron (Fe), magnesium (Mg), copper (Cu), and carbon (C), while improving soil health .
Field trials with DAV College Gorakhpur (wheat) and ICAR-IIPR Kanpur (mungbean) prove Navyakosh’s effectiveness . Wheat trials show a 4.95% yield increase over chemical fertilizers, while mungbean trials reveal a 5% yield increase over recommended chemical fertilizers (RCF) and a 29% increase over the control.
Navyakosh boosts soil P (Phosphorus) by 30.9% (from 15.5 kg/ha to 20.3 kg/ha) and K (Potassium) by 28.7% (from 150 kg/ha to 193 kg/ha) in mungbean trials. Our reports show a 32–74% increase in soil organic matter, with field trials showing a 42% rise.
Navyakosh reduces irrigation demand by 33%, conserving water in regions where 85% of groundwater supports agriculture . We serve farms, gardens, and terrace gardening, ensuring every agricultural space thrives with Navyakosh.
Navyakosh enhances large-scale farming activities. Our biofertilizer supports crops like wheat, paddy, sugarcane, pulses, spices, fruits, and vegetables, making it ideal for expansive farmlands.
Navyakosh’s one-time application eliminates the need for additional fertilizers, reducing chemical use by 30–50% .
Wheat trials with Navyakosh demonstrates a 15.02% cost reduction , while mungbean trials report a net return of ₹38,586/ha compared to ₹34,278/ha for chemical fertilizers.
The soil test report reveals a clay soil with low nitrogen (276 kg/ha) and a high pH (8.66). Navyakosh addresses this nitrogen deficiency with its nitrogen-fixing microbes and improves nutrient availability, as seen in the mungbean study’s 30.9% P (Phosphorous) increase and 28.7% K (Potassium) increase.
Our production capacity of 1,200 ton/month across units in Kushinagar, Auraiya, Prayagraj, Mahoba, Kolhapur, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Assam, and Jharkhand ensures we meet the demands of large-scale farmers. We aim to reach 250,000 farmers, empowering agricultural communities with sustainable, high-yield solutions.
Navyakosh nurtures home gardens with organic, nutrient-rich fertilization formula. Our product suits smaller-scale gardening, supporting vegetables, fruits, spices, and ornamental plants.
Navyakosh enhances soil health, increasing organic matter by 32–74% , which benefits garden soils often depleted by frequent planting. The mungbean study shows Navyakosh improving soil moisture by 9.4% (from 19.0% to 20.8%), ensuring garden plants thrive with less watering.
Its SAP (Super Absorbent Polymer Technology) helps retain water for 35 days, reducing irrigation needs by 33% , a crucial feature for garden spaces with limited water access.
Navyakosh delivers essential micronutrients like Zn, Fe, and Cu, as seen in the soil test reports obtained from field experiments , where Zn (0.87 ppm), Fe (4.0 ppm), and Cu (2.7 ppm) levels support healthy plant growth.
Gardeners benefit from Navyakosh’s one-time application, which simplifies maintenance while promoting vibrant, chemical-free gardens.
Navyakosh enables terrace gardening with ease and sustainability. Urban dwellers cultivate fresh produce like vegetables, herbs, and small fruits on terraces, and Navyakosh provides the perfect solution.
Our biofertilizer’s lightweight, organic composition suits container gardening, delivering nutrients directly to plants. Our field tests indicates that Navyakosh can reduces crop duration by 5–8%, as confirmed in the mungbean study (maturity reduced by 2–4 days) . This feature allows terrace gardeners to harvest faster, maximizing limited space.
Navyakosh’s SAP (Super Absorbent Polymer Technology) helps absorbs 268 times its weight in water, ensuring plants in pots or raised beds stay hydrated with minimal watering—a 33% reduction in irrigation demand.
The soil test report indicates a high pH (8.66), which Navyakosh’s microbial activity can help buffer over time, while its nutrient profile (N, P, K, Zn, Fe, etc.) supports healthy growth in confined spaces. Terrace gardeners enjoy fresh, organic produce with Navyakosh’s eco-friendly, efficient fertilization.
LCB Fertilizers stands as your partner in sustainable agriculture, offering Navyakosh to enhance farms, gardens, and terrace gardening.
Our biofertilizer, developed through biotechnology, nanotechnology, and chemical engineering, delivers superior yields, reduces costs, and promotes environmental health.
