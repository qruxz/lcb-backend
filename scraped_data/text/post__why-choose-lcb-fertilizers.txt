LCB Fertilizers stands as a trusted ally for farmers, offering innovative, sustainable solutions that transform agriculture. Today we will highlight the four key reasons to choose LCB Fertilizers: Superior Crop Growth, Cost Effectiveness, Government Approval, and Eco-Friendliness.
We draw on extensive data from field trials, soil tests, and our operational insights to demonstrate why LCB Fertilizers leads the way in organic farming. Here we will discuss each reason, showcasing our commitment to farmers, the environment, and agricultural excellence.
LCB Fertilizers delivers exceptional crop growth through our flagship product, Navyakosh, a crop-specific biofertilizer.
Navyakosh combines a microbial consortium of 20–60 strains, 20.93 nm biogenically synthesized nanoparticles, and a super absorbent polymer (SAP) to provide essential nutrients like nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), zinc (Zn), sulphur (S), iron (Fe), magnesium (Mg), copper (Cu), and carbon (C).
Our field trials with DAV College Gorakhpur (wheat) and ICAR-IIPR Kanpur (mungbean) confirm Navyakosh’s impact. Wheat trials show a 4.95% yield increase over chemical fertilizers, while mungbean trials reveal a 5% yield increase over recommended chemical fertilizers (RCF) and a 29% increase over the control.
Navyakosh also boosts soil health, increasing soil P (Phosphorous) by 30.9% (from 15.5 kg/ha to 20.3 kg/ha) and K (Potassium) by 28.7% (from 150 kg/ha to 193 kg/ha) in mungbean trials.
Farmers experience remarkable growth, with our Navyakosh fertilizers supporting a wide range of crops, including wheat, paddy, sugarcane, pulses, spices, fruits, and vegetables.
Choose LCB Fertilizers to unlock your fields’ full potential with nutrient-rich, organic solutions.
LCB Fertilizers provides a cost-effective solution that reduces farming expenses while maintaining high yields.
Navyakosh, a one-time-use biofertilizer, cuts the need for additional chemical fertilizers by 30–50%.
Wheat trials demonstrate a 15.02% cost reduction, with Navyakosh achieving higher yields at a lower cost than chemical fertilizers.
Mungbean trials further confirm this, showing a net return of ₹38,586/ha compared to ₹34,278/ha for chemical fertilizers. Field tests highlights cost reduction range of 5–48%, depending on the crop and location, ensuring farmers save on inputs while boosting productivity.
Navyakosh also reduces irrigation demand by 33% through its SAP (Super Absorbent Polymer Technology), which absorbs 268 times its weight in water and retains it for 35 days, lowering water-related expenses in regions where 85% of groundwater supports irrigation.
